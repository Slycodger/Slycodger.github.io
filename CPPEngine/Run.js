It is still a decent way to test out OpenGL within C++ with object control, text, some form of a camera system, shader control, and just vague stuff you need for an engine.  There has been all sorts of things in here that I decided to remove/set aside such as stencil lighting, lines, auto rebuild on file change, and a script viewer.  I have not made a version for easy use yet as this git has just been a way to save the files individually, instead of sharing the entire project for use out of the box.  This is definitely not a good engine, but can be used as a baseline for creating things.  Think of it as a template project that you can build yourself.  If I get better at all of this I will come back and redo most things to make this a proper engine.  The reason for 90% of the code being HTML is because of one of the libraries.  I think it's freeType but I'm not too sure.  The entire project that I made is around 3000 lines.  So it's pretty small if you want to change up stuff or look through for yourself.  Be prepared to be disappointed, I never made any neat or nice code since I want to work on something else", "h1");
