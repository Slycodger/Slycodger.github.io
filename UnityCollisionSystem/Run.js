It does not support rotations as I made this before I got into the mess of transformations.  The code is just about unreadable for me because I only really learned how to write readable code recently.  There should already be a scene prepared, or you can create your own.  It should support all closed meshes as long as they aren't rotated in the Unity editor.  I have not thoroughly tested this, but from what I can remember it shouldn't have any issues with any closed meshes.", "h1");
